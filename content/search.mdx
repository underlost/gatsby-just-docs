Gatsby Just Docs is powered by Algolia to add client side search powered by a JSON index that Gatsby generates on *build*. Search results are shown in an auto complete dropdown. There is no search page. By default, all search results are indexed using the following data points:

- title
- MetaTitle
- MetaDescription

## Enabling search

Search can be enabled by supplying Algolia APi credentials in the `config.js` file. Refer to the [configuration](/configuration/) for more details.

## Generating search results

Search results are generated on the Gatsby build command.

## Hiding pages from search

Currently all MDX files will be indexed and fully searchable. Allowing pages to be flagged as not indexed is a planned feature for the future.
