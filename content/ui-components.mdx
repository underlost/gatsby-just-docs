## UI Components

To make it as easy as possible to write documentation in plain Markdown, most UI components are styled using default Markdown elements with few additional CSS classes needed and MDX components.

## Buttons

Buttons can be styled using the Button component. [Learn More](/ui-components/buttons/)

## Labels

Use labels as a way to add an additional mark to a section of your docs. [Learn More](/ui-components/labels/)

## Typography

By default, Gatsby Just Docs uses a native system font stack for sans-serif fonts, but with a couple of additional classes, but sizing can be adjusted. [Learn More](/ui-components/typography/)

## Tables

Tables are built with basic markdown. [See Examples](/ui-components/tables/)

## Code

Code highlighting is accomplished with PrismJS. [Learn More](/ui-components/code/)
