## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Gatsby Just Docs is built for GatsbyJS, a React-based static site generator. Just the docs requires no additional setup beyond what's normal expected when setting up a Gatsby site locally. For more details into how Gatsyby works, check out their [quick start guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/). 

### Running Locally

Running Gatsby Just Docs isnt any different then any other Gatsby based site, and can be up and running in just a few commands:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:underlost/gatsby-just-docs.git
cd gatsby-just-docs
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Production

Gatsby Just Docs has been tested to run in just about any enviroment a normal GatsbyJS can run, such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/).

If youre looking to host the site on more traditional host, run 

```shell
yarn build
```

to create a public folder that you can then upload anywhere!

### Configuring 

Gatsby Just Docs has a number of helpful settings. Refer to the [configuration](/configuration/) section for all options available.
