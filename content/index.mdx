## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Gatsby Just Docs is built for GatsbyJS, a React-based static site generator. Just the docs requires no additional setup beyond what's normal expected when setting up a Gatsby site locally. For more details into how Gatsyby works, check out their [quick start guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/). 

### Running Locally

### Production

Gatsby Just Docs has been tested to run in just about any enviroment a normal GatsbyJS can run, such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/).
