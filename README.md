# Gatsby Just Docs

A powerful MDX based authoring framework for building great documentation.

## Motivation

I wanted to set up a documentation site for a new project I've been working on. I wanted something modern, with a great design, that also supported MDX. Something that also had a grate styling framework to easily build new, beautiful looking components as needed. I loved the look of Just The Docs, but didnt like the limitations of Jekyll and regular markdown. As I started to port the theme over to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), I took the oppertunity to add new features, like better darkmode support, and PrismJS syntax highlight.

## Features

- Write in MDX
- Optional, realtime Search powered by [Algoria](https://www.algolia.com/)
- Dark mode theme, with toggle functionality. Settings even persist through page refresh!
- Fully customizable CSS framework, useful for easily building out new components, with classes similar to Bootstrap.
- Live code editor. Render react components for live editing!
- Easy deployment on Netlify or with Docker.
- Edit on Github
- Syntax Highlighting using Prism
- Progressive Web App, Works Offline
- SEO friendly- Set meta title and meta descriptions for pages.
- Google Analytics support
